    <p>My name is Eric Seitz.</p>
    <p>It was given to me by my parents in 1992,

    <h2>My Goals For This Course</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn the basics of web development</li>
      <li>Gain a foundational understanding of how to create via code</li>
      <li>Supplement my passions (as mentioned below) with the ability to professionally present them on the internet</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section id="p2">
      <p>I'm a media production major focused primarily on photography and sound design/music production.
      Ten years ago, I graduated high school in the suburbs of Indianapolis, IN, and began school in state
      at IU in Bloomington. For the next two years, I studied germanic linguistics and german literature,
      which ultimately ended in dropping out of school. Not to go too into detail, but the whole turn of events
      really came down to having no clue where I wanted to go with my life after school ended.
      Enter CU in the Fall of 2018.
      After years away from school working low-paying jobs, I finally had somewhat of a lightbulb moment. What I
      wanted was to create, and to work with and around all of the incredible emerging technologies which were shaping
      the narrative around the future, and building and destroying entire industries in their wake-- I don't mean this
      in an exclusively bad way, such technologies are likely to be what allows for a better world one of these days.
      Anyways, the most fundamental component of who I am is curiosity, and I feel that media production, coding, and
      the creation and development of more effective technology is crucial to shaping the impact I want to have on the
      world at large.</p>
