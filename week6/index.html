  <h2>This <span id="first">Website</span> is really interactive.</h2>
  <p id="paragraph">This website exists for one purpose, and one purpose alone. It is interactive. Visitors are meant to interact with it, so go ahead, push some buttons and interact with some things. It's not much, but if it's one thing, it's interactive!</p>

  <h2>These are the buttons you can use to interact with this interactive site:</h2>
  <button id="mybutton">Click Here</button>
  <button id="mybutton2">Click Here Too!</button>
  <button id="mybutton3">Click Here Too Much!</button>

Sure you could find more interaction on some other site that was designed by an experienced professional, but you won't find any with this much...well, ok...fine.
